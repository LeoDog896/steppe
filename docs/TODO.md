## necessities

- refactor, comment, and clean up codebase: *i want this terminal to be modifiable at source*. plugins would be nice too!
- choose launch shell
- terminal tabs
- terminator-like pane splitting
- an actual settings file

## niceties

- import vscode themes
- js-based repl integrated with the terminal context (some kind of terminal shortcut to spawn a repl that integrates with the current terminal context, like emacs)
    - arbitrary npm support?
- window vibrancy (blurred, translucent background!)
- terminal pets and general display niceities
- confetti
- warp.cli-like terminal blocks (and easy asciicinema-based sharing of terminal blocks)
