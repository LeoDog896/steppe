(i might make this a blogpost)

i do NOT care about terminal performance!!! look. i like fast terminal emulators.
i think they're cool and awesome and super cool!! i think rotting software sucks and we should
be building faster software from the ground up! but. i would like my terminal to be mine!
i want more than realizing my [fast:tm: terminal emulator doesn't support ligatures](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/50)
or noticing that kitty doesn't have [tmux support](https://gavinhoward.com/2022/02/goodbye-kitty/), and not
being able to do anything about either because its hard to modify the source code!

## on hyper.js

this terminal emulator is written in js. there was also another popular js terminal emulator, hyper.js. however,
it leaned more onto the utility and practicality aspect of its terminal emulator. though, having a terminal emulator
written in *js* out of all languages is *insane!* i would like a terminal emulator thats not only
*easy to modify*, but one that you can also do silly things with! thats why this terminal emulator leans
fully into the horror and chaos of such a language choice, by allowing during-runtime modification and overall playfulness with customization.
